### Revision 5

## Ingredient List
- 5 Whole Carrots (sliced)
- 2 Cups sliced Onion (white)
- 1 Cup sliced Red Bell Pepper (thickly sliced)
- 1 Cup sliced Green Bell Pepper (thickly sliced)
- 4 Cups cut green beans
- 1 1/2 Cups sliced Bella Mushrooms
- 2 Cans Lima Beans
- 1 Can Sweet Peas
- 1 Can Black Beans
- 1 Family Sized Can Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup
- 1 10.5oz Can Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup
- 2 tbsp Butter

## Spices
- 1-1/2 tbsp Salt
- 1-1/2 tbsp Pepper
- 1 tbsp Paprika
- 1 tbsp Garlic Powder
- 2 or 3 bay leaves

## Steps
* Preheat slow cooker to low
* Rinse all fresh ingredients
* Add Fresh Ingredients to pot (carrots, onion, red & green pepper, green beans, mushrooms)
* Pour 10.5oz can cream of mushroom soup over fresh ingredients
* Add salt, pepper, paprika, and galric powder
* Drain a small amount of liquid (~10-15% of total liquid in can) from all canned ingredients (lima beans, sweet peas, black beans)
* Add all canned ingredients to pot
* Pour familiy sized can of Cream of Mushroom soup over canned ingredients
* Add butter
* Add bay leaves
* Allow to cook for 4-6 hours, depending on how thick you chopped the vegetables.
* After fully cooked. Add additional salt/pepper/paprika/garlic powder to taste. I typically end up doubling the measurments above

## Notes
This produces a very thick stew. To make it more soup like, don't drain anything from the canned ingredients, and add 1-2 cups of beef or vegetable broth.

This is heavy on green beans. You may want to substitute 1 cup green beans for another item.

This revision came out to be more earthy than expected. It's more mushroom stew than veggie stew. The next revision should reduce mushrooms and replace with vegetables.

Historially this recipe has benefited from sitting in the refridgerator. Becoming more favorful with each passing day. Revision 4 is an exception to this. It was slightly better fresh than re-heated.
