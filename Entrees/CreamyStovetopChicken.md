# Creamy Stovetop Chicken

### Revision 1

## Ingredient List
- 1-1/3 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast (I use four 1/3lb breasts)
- 1/2 cup sliced red onion
- 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms (white or baby bella both work)
- 1/2 cup sliced red bell pepper
- 1-1/2 tbsp butter
- 10.5oz cream of chicken

## Spices
- salt
- pepper

## Steps
* allow chicken to come to near room temperature
* pre-heat pan to med-low, then add 1/2 tbsp butter
* salt and pepper 1 side of the chicken, then place in pan seasoned side down
* salt and pepper the exposed side
* allow to cook uncovered 5 minutes
* turn chicken over, add 1/2 tbsp butter
* cover pan and allow to cook 5 minutes
* remove chicken from pan and set aside to rest
* if the chicken contained enough fat to leave renderings, remove as much as possible, but leave behind the butter it cooked in
* add onion, mushrooms, red peppers, 1/2 tbsp butter to pan. Lightly season with salt and pepper.
* saute until onion just begins to caramelize 
* add cream of chicken to pan
* cook for 3-5 minutes stirring occasionally
* Add chicken to pan, cover, and continue to cook for 3-5 minutes

## Notes
I typically serve by spooning the creamy sauce over a chicken breast. 

This recipe works with as little as 1lb chicken, and as much as 1-1/2lbs chicken.

Occasionally I'll add rosemary to the pan when cooking the chicken (remove before cooking vegetables). It's hit or miss depending on what sides this entree is being paired with.
