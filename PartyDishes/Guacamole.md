# Guacamole

### Revision 1

## Ingredient List
- 3 large ripe avacados
- 1 lime
- 3 cloves garlic (minced) (optionally substitute garlic powder)
- 1/2 red onion (chopped)
- 2 roma tomatoes (de-seeded and diced)

## Spices
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1/2 tbsp garlic powder (optional - use if not using garlic cloves)
- 2 tbsp cilantro (chopped)

## Steps
* Pit and peel the avacados, add to large mixing bowl
* Add salt and mash the avacados to your preferred consistency
* Cut lime in half and mix juice from 1 half lime into the avacado mixutre
* Allow to sit 5-10 minutes
* Mix in onion, tomatoes, cilantro, and garlic powder
* Refridgerate at least 1 hour
* Taste and use salt, garlic powder, and/or the second half of the lime to complete seasoning

## Notes
Because the size of avacados varies significantly, the last step is utilized to balance the flavor. It can be skipped if not needed.

To add spice, include 1 deseeded and diced jalepeno pepper or a small amount of cayenne powder

Lemon works almost as well as lime if lime is unavailable

The original recipe called for 3 cloves of minced garlic. In a pinch, I used 1/2 tbsp of powder instead. The flavor was wonderful. I prefer the powder to the fresh cloves for this

## Yield
Not enough. You can never have enough guac.
~ 3 cups if I were to venture a guess.
