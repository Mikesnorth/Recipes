# Recipes
An ever expanding and evolving collection of recipes

This recipe book is a collection of the food that I love to cook for myself and my family. It is a collection of recipes that have been passed down by my parents and grandparens, supplemented by some of my own origin. To the best of my knowledge, it does not contain any direct copies of recipes found elsewhere. Some recipes found in this colleciton are based on recipes found while googling for foods that I wanted to try, but I will not include any direct copies.

I hope you enjoy these as much as I have.

## Important notes
As I explore these recipes, not every version is a hit. Sometimes the results of an alterartion do not go well. In the event that a revision doesn't go over so well, I will not pull the recipe, but will do my best to keep this book up to date with notes of an unpleasant revision, why it was unpleasant, and plans to adjust it.

No recipes that have not been cooked and tasted will be merged. Suggested changes will be left as a draft until taste tested. 

## Contribution rules
Anyone is free to open a pull request to this repository with a recipe. I intend to cook and taste every recipe before merging, so please have patience as it may take some time for me to do so. As long as a submisison is reasonable, I will accept it. No recipe will be rejected simply because it does not fit my personal taste.

Do not submit a recipe that is taken as-is from another souce unless the root source explicitly allows re-distribution. Only submit noticably revised recipes, or homemade recipes that you don't mind becoming public.

When submitting a revision, I may accept as is, but I do reseve the right to create a new recipe instead of accepting it as a revision if I see fit.
